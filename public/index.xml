      <description>Sherlocks - Medium Sherlock Scenario&#xA;A critical Forela Dev server was targeted by a threat group. The Dev server was accidentally left open to the internet which it was not supposed to be. The senior dev Abdullah told the IT team that the server was fully hardened and it&amp;rsquo;s still difficult to comprehend how the attack took place and how the attacker got access in the first place. Forela recently started its business expansion in Pakistan and Abdullah was the one IN charge of all infrastructure deployment and management.</description>

      <description>Sherlocks - Easy Sherlock Scenario&#xA;As a digital forensics investigator, you received an urgent request from a client managing multiple proxy Kubernetes clusters. The client reports unusual behavior in one of their development environments, where they were testing a proxy via SSH. This environment was exposed to the internet, raising concerns about a potential security breach. You have been provided with a dump of the kube-system namespace, as most of the testing activity occurred there.</description>

      <description>Sherlocks - Easy Sherlock Scenario&#xA;NeuroSyncâ„¢ is a leading suite of products focusing on developing cutting edge medical BCI devices, designed by the Korosaki Coorporaton. Recently, an APT group targeted them and was able to infiltrate their infrastructure and is now moving laterally to compromise more systems. It appears that they have even managed to hijack a large number of online devices by exploiting an N-day vulnerability. Your task is to find out how they were able to compromise the infrastructure and understand how to secure it.</description>

      <description>Sherlocks - Easy Sherlock Scenario&#xA;Happy Grunwald contacted the sysadmin, Alonzo, because of issues he had downloading the latest version of Microsoft Office. He had received an email saying he needed to update, and clicked the link to do it. He reported that he visited the website and solved a captcha, but no office download page came back. Alonzo, who himself was bombarded with phishing attacks last year and was now aware of attacker tactics, immediately notified the security team to isolate the machine as he suspected an attack.</description>

      <description>These are all notes I took while learning reverse engineering (still a work in progress). I plan to complement them with further research, including videos and other resources. This is very uncharted territory for me so bear with me.&#xA;RE theory&#xA;When you compile a binary in C , what happens ? gcc myProgram.c -o myProgram.exe&#xA;It goes through these 4 stages , this is called Language Processing System.&#xA;(Preprocessor &amp;mdash;&amp;gt; Compiler &amp;mdash;&amp;gt; Assembler &amp;mdash;&amp;gt; Linker ) &amp;mdash;-&amp;gt; myProgram.</description>
