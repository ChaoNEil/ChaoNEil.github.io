Hi, I am **Chao Neil Aryan Borgohain** and I'm just a n00b trying to be a **cyber security analyst**.

Currently I'm working on my Sec+ certificate and also doing home labs.

Things that I am interested: 

* Malware Analysis
* Malware Development
* ...some rev engineering


I can't put my whole cybersecurity origin story here, so if you want to know more, there should be a link here somewhere
