Hi, I am **Chao Neil Aryan Borgohain** and I'm just a n00b trying to be a **cyber security analyst**.

Currently I have the Google Cybersecurity certificate and I'm working on my **Sec+** certificate, also, at the same time following the HackTheBox CDSA (SOC) job path. I have also set up home labs to practice attacks and defense and analyse malwares.

Things that I am interested: 

* Malware Analysis
* Malware Development
* ...some rev engineering


I can't put my whole cybersecurity origin story here, so if you want to know more, there should be a link here somewhere
